	EDN Library for .NET
# Summary
This library provides the following [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) support for .NET:  
* EDN Reader/Parser: Access to the EDN abstract syntax tree(AST)  
* EDN Serialization: An extensible framework for EDN serialization and deserialization  

# Why not use clojure.clr?
Why not use the clojure.clr instead edn-dot-net
* The ability to customize serialization and deserilization, e.g., you might want your EDN ints to be int32 instead of BigInts
* Idiomatic .NET collection behavior (whats assoc?).
